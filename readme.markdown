<h1 text-align="center"><h1>Get Tweets Twitter API</h1>

<p text-align="center"><project-description>
My first attempt at using Twitter API was for this code, and I was learning how to use the API in Python. Given my background in journalism, I decided to write code that retrieves tweets containing a particular hashtag (#مهسا_امینی).
The code is straightforward; after authenticating the Twitter API, I specified a set of tweets obtained via Tweepy. I then created a For loop, which saved each tweet in a data frame with a certain set of data. According to their popularity or number of likes, I organized them in a CSV file. I used the data to conduct research on the Women, Life, Freedom movement in Iran.
